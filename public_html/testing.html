	<h2>Feather - Nujabes</h2>
	<p>Light as feather when I'm floating through, Reading through the daily news. Measuring the hurt within the golden rule. Centimeters of ether, I'm heating the speaker. Motivational teacher with words that burn people. Seeing the headlines lined with discord it's either genocide or the planet in uproar. Never good. The rules of paradise are never nice. The best laid plans of Mice and Men are never right. I'm just a vagabond with Flowers for Algernon. The Average Joes who knows what the fuck is going on. It's the of my thoughts that I travel upon. Fly like an arrow of god until I'm gone, so I'm........

	<p>Bright colored robotic space rhinoceri. That we pilot. why? Cause' they're in supply. Plus we heed the cry of our planet's population to defend them. We report to battle stations. Split-screen ready, and are rhinos are rocketships with fully articulated tusks, jaws, and hips. They come equipped with individual special attacks. None with a lack, but a couple a little bit slack.
